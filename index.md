Hi👋, I’m Qianli Wang and work as a NLP researcher dedicated to advancing the interpretability and explainability of LLMs at [XplainNLP group](https://www.tu.berlin/qu/forschung/forschungsgruppen/xplainlp), [Quality and Usability Lab](https://www.tu.berlin/qu), [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/) under the supervision of [Sebastian Möller](https://www.tu.berlin/qu/ueber-uns/leitung).

# Research interests 👀
Topics of interest are _post-hoc explanations_ (especially counterfactual example, free-text rationale), _interactive conversational XAI systems_, _mechanistic interpretability_, _reasoning_, _multilinguality_, _evaluation_.

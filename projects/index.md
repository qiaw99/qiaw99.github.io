Together with _Premtim Sahitaj_ and _Daniel RÃ¶der_.
#### Details: 
<details> 
  <summary>
    Our project focuses on developing a Conversational Verification platform 
  </summary> 
  that ensures the factual accuracy of AI-generated content within corporate environments. By integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, we aim to align generative outputs with organizational knowledge bases, ensuring compliance with corporate policies and maintaining brand integrity.
  A key innovation is the incorporation of Conversational Explainable AI (ConvXAI) principles, providing users with interactive, dialogue-based explanations. This feature allows users to query, validate, and refine verification results in real time, enhancing transparency and trust in the system's outputs.
  The platform offers a secure, internal-facing application enabling companies to verify generative content against their proprietary knowledge bases. This includes validating AI-generated content for compliance, brand alignment, and factual accuracy, thereby reducing risks associated with deploying generative AI systems in corporate environments.
